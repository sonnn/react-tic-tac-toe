Design Patterns - Best Practises
* Centralize state / store - no component state (MObx)
 - Explain Classes
 - The App Store object is a simple singleton with the entire app/game state

* Smart and presentational (stateless) components (http://tsevdos.github.io/presentations/react-mobx-2017/index.html#/3/1) - https://github.com/krasimir/react-in-patterns/tree/master/patterns/presentational-and-container
 - Containers components
 - Stateless (presentational) components
* Layouts
 - layout containers for UI layouts (curently 1 but we can easily add more)
* configuration / helpers
* index files collect all modules/components for easier access and organization
* CSS modules ()

Design desicions
- Mobx, central store and objects
 - pure ES6 Objects. Keep the
 - Observable pattern
 - Business logic
